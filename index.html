<h1>Materials<br> x Mobility</h1><h2>From the WBC's 2050 vision, what are the material trends<br>both macro (manufacturing) and micro (material level) that might contribute?</h2>

<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item"><h5>FUTURE VISION</h5></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Energy Efficiency</h6><p>Novel techniques in fabrication and production enable enough cut costs that the manufacture of parts that before may have been too expensive to produce</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Value Chain Innovation</h6><p>Innovation in 3rd party manufactoring and services that explore different methods of fabrication and organization structure may play a critical role in enabling a the feasible production of personal aerial vehicles. Less material with equal or greater strength means parts will be lighter and more sustainable to make.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Closed Loop Zero waste</h6><p>More durable, higher quality materials leads to less material used. Designs can be made to be recycled; Appleâ€™s robotic system liam sets a good example for creating a system that reuses material. If the closed loop design were to be considered, landfills could be a thing of the past.</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h5>MACRO TRENDS</h5><img src="macro.png"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Pressure for Sustainable materials</h6><img src="sustainable.png"><p> In the United States, $35 billion of annual chemical industry sales flow to motor vehicles
<br></br>A typical automobile that contains more than $3,000 worth of chemistry,
<br></br>330+ pounds of plastics and polymer composites and 270+ pounds of rubber, textiles, and coatings, and this might increase as vehicle interiors shift from being largely utilitarian to enabling an in-transit experience offering business and entertainment options
<br></br>More modularity: replacing interior components that fail from increased wear and tear before the rest of the vehicle.
</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Better Motors</h6><img src="motor.jpg"><p>Automobile motors are trying to get smaller, for smaller vehicles. Recent material innovations could drastically improve motor efficiency but the costs are prohibitive; new cooling technology that allows motor size to reduce by 75%. Improved heat removal means motors can carry four times more current than usual to deliver four times more torque.<br></br>Electric integration; GM recently declared to go all electric, ideally designing around 20 fully electric models by 2023.
<br></br>Improved heat removal allows the motor to carry four times more current than usual, and to deliver four times more torque, at a quarter of the size</p></div>  
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Additive Manufactoring</h6><img src="procedural.jpg"><p>Additive manufacturing allows for production of more complex shapes and thus empowers procedural design of parts. Which is key because 'Having the ability to tune the mechanics of materials by simply adjusting its geometry opens the door to a wide variety of practical applications...including strong lightweight structural materials for airplanes, cars, buildings' - MIT Researcher
<br></br>Procedurally generated form takes traditional parts and optimizes it for strength and minimal material. Additive processes enables the mass manufacture of such complex shapes, which is key to the innovation in certain materials (see below)
<br></br>Started being used for making super lightweight aerospace parts</p></div>

  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Batteries</h6><img src="lithium.png"><p>Increase in battery, high performance, and commodity polymers<br></br>
Advances in battery = costs falling roughly 80 percent between 2010 and 2017 to $209 per kilowatt-hour</div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Carbon Nano Tubes</h6><img src="carbonNano.png"></div>  
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Aerographene</h6><img src="aerographene.png"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="micro.png"><h5>MICRO CHANGES</h5></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><h6>Carbon Fiber</h6><img src="carbonFiber.png"></div>
